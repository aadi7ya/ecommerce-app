    <h2>The Richard Bernard Experience</h2>
    <p>
      The rcb description component should be wrapped in a <code>&lt;nav&gt;</code> element to identify it as a navigation section to screen readers and other assistive technologies. In addition, as a page is likely to have more than one such navigation section already (such as the primary navigation in the header, or a sidebar navigation), it is advisable to provide a descriptive <code>aria-label</code> for the <code>&lt;nav&gt;</code> which reflects its purpose. For example, if the pagination component is used to navigate between a set of search results, an appropriate label could be <code>aria-label="Search results pages"</code>.
